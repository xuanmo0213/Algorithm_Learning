/*
Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
*/

//It's more like a brainstorm, O(n) solution 12 ms, the idea is increment 1 to n - 1 elements equals to extract 1 from max element
public class Solution {

    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int min = nums[0];
        for (int n : nums) min = Math.min(min, n);
        int res = 0;
        for (int n : nums) res += n - min;
        return res;
    }   

}
